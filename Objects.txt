Question : Write a blog on the Difference between document & window objects ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:

The Window object and the Document object are both important objects in web development,
but they serve different purposes.

The Window object represents the browser window that a web page is loaded into. It is the 
top-level object in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy, and it provides a 
global scope for all JavaScript code running within the window.

The Window object has many properties and methods that can be used to manipulate the browser 
window, such as opening new windows, navigating to new URLs, and resizing the window. It also 
contains information about the user's device, such as screen resolution and browser version.

The Document object, on the other hand, represents the web page that is currently loaded in the 
browser window. It is a property of the Window object and is accessible through the window.document property.

The Document object has properties and methods that allow you to manipulate the content and 
structure of the web page, such as modifying the HTML and CSS, adding or removing elements, 
and querying the page for specific elements.

In summary, the Window object represents the browser window itself and provides a global scope
for JavaScript code running within it, while the Document object represents the web page that
is currently loaded in the window and provides methods and properties for manipulating its 
content and structure.

window objects has its own properties and methods,example:
